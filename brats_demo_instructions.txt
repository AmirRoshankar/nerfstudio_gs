###### DEMO INSTRUCTIONS ######
###############################

1. Follow the instructions for installing the conda environment for the original 
version of the viewer modified for Gaussian Splatting

2. Clone my repository:
    git clone https://github.com/AmirRoshankar/nerfstudio_gs.git

3. Checkout the demo branch:
    git checkout brain_demo

4. Create an alias for ease of use of the script:
    alias gvisL="python nerfstudio/scripts/gaussian_splatting/run_viewer_layered.py --model_path"

5. Launch the viewer. For the demo on Dec 8th, the [path_to_layered_output] 
is "/pub0/data/gaussian_splats_data/demo/brats_rand_background_delayed_more/"
    gvisL [path_to_layered_output]

6. Controls:
    Use left click hold and drag to rotate.
    Use right click hold and drag to translate.
    Scroll to zoom in and out of the scene.
    Toggle "Intensity" or "Depth" to see respective views
    Select layer range desired on right-hand side.
    Layer ranges are shown as floats, but this is not a problem, just input ints
    For the demo on Dec 8th, min layer range is [0, max layer] inclusive
    Max layer is in range [min layer, 113] inclusive

7. Important:
    Invalid ranges will cause the viewer to crash.
    If this happens, correcting the ranges sometimes fixes it.
    If this doesn't work, relaunch the viewer.
